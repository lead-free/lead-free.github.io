### About Me

Hi. I am a researcher and a graduate student at the City University of New York working with the [*CCNY Robotics Lab*](https://ccny-ros-pkg.github.io). I build robotic embedded systems from pcb layout to path planning algorithms for various NSF lab-to-market endeavors ~~that sponsor my further education~~.  

Aside from building robots, I am interested in algorithms, particularly path finding problems. I am currently exploring the field of [*evolutionary computations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation) and tweaking neural networks (aka [neuroevolution](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html)).

When I am not at the lab you can find me [*backpacking*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sl-vision/) and social dancing (pre pandemic) ballroom, fusion/blues, and contact improv.
### Contact
I am always open to connect, share, and explore with enthusiastic creatures.
