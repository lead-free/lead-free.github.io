## About Me

Hi. I identify as an engineer-scientist with a mixed background in computer 
science, electrical engineering, and physics.

### Sendyne Corp ###

Currently employed at [Sendyne Corp.](https://www.sendyne.com) where we work on 
research and development of various automotive grade sensors. 
Our work involves modeling, sensing, and control. 
Most of our code resembles python, modern C++, and occasionally javascript.

### CCNY Robotics Lab ###

Brought into the light working with the 
[*CCNY Robotics Lab*](https://ccny-ros-pkg.github.io). Here I prototyped robot 
architectures for various industrial inspection processes -- from PCB and 
embedded firmware design to path planning algorithms.

### Personal ###

When I am away form the keyboard and oscilloscope probes you can find me [*backpacking*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sl-vision/) and social dancing (pre pandemic) ballroom, fusion/blues, and contact improv.

### Contact ###
I am always open to connect, share, and explore with enthusiastic creatures.
