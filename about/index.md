## About Me

Hi. I identify as an engineer-scientist with a mixed background in computer 
science, electrical engineering, and physics.

### Sendyne Corp ###

Currently with [Sendyne Corp.](https://www.sendyne.com) as an embedded systems engineer where I work on research and development of various automotive grade sensors. Most of my work involves programming and sensor data analysis. Most of our code resembles python, modern C++, and javascript at times.

### CCNY Robotics Lab ###

My journey starts here, at my alma mater, The City University of New York, where I was brought into the light working with the [*CCNY Robotics Lab*](https://ccny-ros-pkg.github.io). Here I dprototype the core robotic architecures for various industrial inspection processes -- from PCB and embedded firmware design to path planning algorithms.

### Personal ###

When I am away form the keyboard and oscilloscope probes you can find me [*backpacking*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sl-vision/) and social dancing (pre pandemic) ballroom, fusion/blues, and contact improv.

### Contact ###
I am always open to connect, share, and explore with enthusiastic creatures.
